```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

# Attach packages 

library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(janitor)
library(broom) # cleans up test outputs so we can include it in line in text
```

## Read in the data 
```{r}
lizards <- read.csv(here("data", "lizards.csv"))
```

## Get counts of lizards by species
```{r}
lizards %>% 
  count(spp) %>% 
  arrange(-n) # arrange the counts of lizard species in decreasing order 
```
## Make a subset 

- UTST lizards
- Sites: IBPE (enclosure grassland), RABB (rabbit mesquite site), "EAST" (east tarbush site)
- Tail condition is recorded (W = whole, B = broken)

```{r}
utst <- lizards %>% 
  filter(spp == "UTST") %>% 
  filter(site %in% c("IBPE", "RABB", "EAST")) %>% 
  filter(tail %in% c("B", "W"))
```
